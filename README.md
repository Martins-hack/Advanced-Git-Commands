## Advanced Git Commands

As you become more comfortable with Git, you'll want to explore some advanced commands that can enhance your workflow. This section covers rebasing, merging, and stashing, which are essential for managing changes effectively.

### 1. Rebase
Rebasing allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It’s often used to maintain a clean project history. Here’s how to do it:

1. First, switch to your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
2. Then, rebase onto the main branch:
git rebase main
This command takes the changes from the feature-branch and reapplies them on top of the latest changes from the main branch.

Benefits of Rebasing
Keeps the project history linear and clean.
Easier to understand the commit history.
 ### 2. Merge
Merging is another way to integrate changes from one branch into another. This command combines the histories of both branches.
1. Switch to the main branch:
git checkout main
2. Then, merge the feature branch into main:
git merge feature-branch
When to Use Merge
When you want to combine histories from two branches without losing the context of each branch’s changes.
Merging creates a new "merge commit" in the history.
3. ###  Stashing
Stashing is useful when you need to switch branches but want to save your uncommitted changes temporarily.
1. To stash your changes, use:
git stash
2. You can list stashed changes with:
git stash list
3. To apply the stashed changes later:
git stash apply
Benefits of Stashing
### >Allows you to switch contexts without committing unfinished work.
### >Keeps your working directory clean.

### Summary
Understanding these advanced Git commands will help you manage your code more effectively as you work on larger projects or collaborate with others. Practice these commands in a safe environment to become comfortable with their functionality.

### Next Steps
